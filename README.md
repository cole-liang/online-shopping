A small online vegetable shopping website using Angular2+ and Firebase

Live Demo: https://online-shopping-mall-cole.firebaseapp.com/

Important messages:
1. Some pages require Google account
2. I have implemented roles(basically two roles: normal customer and administrator). The admin role has opened now for experiencing the whole functions.
3. Some pages are still working, such as pages related to successfully ordering products, not found pages(pages exist but no content).

To do list:
1. Add searching function on the home page.
2. Carousel showcase on the home page.
3. Further UI improvements.

This website contains content such as authentication and authorization, error handling and pages layout design, giving real-time interaction of purchasing vegetable with Firebase.

Tools involved: Bootstrap, Font awesome, Angular5-data-table, Ng2-validation, Angularfire2

Hope that you will enjoy experiencing this shopping website.
