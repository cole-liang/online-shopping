A small online vegetable shopping website using Angular2+ and Firebase

Live Demo: https://online-shopping-mall-cole.firebaseapp.com/

Important messages:
1. Some pages require Google account
2. I have implemented roles(basically two roles: normal customer and administrator), and I have to manually manage the admin role in the database. The admin role has opened now and enjoy experiencing.
3. Some pages are still working, such as pages related to successfully ordering products, viewing order details, not found pages(pages exist but no content).

This website contains content such as authentication and authorization, error handling and pages layout design, giving real-time interaction of purchasing vegetable with Firebase.

Tools involved: Bootstrap, Font awesome, Angular5-data-table, Ng2-validation, Angularfire2

Hope that you will enjoy experiencing this shopping website.
